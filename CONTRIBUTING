# Contributing to Z-to-Agda

Thanks for your interest! All contributions are welcome — bug reports, new Z features, more examples, documentation improvements, or even just typo fixes.

## How to contribute

### 1. Found a bug or missing Z feature?
- Open an issue first (unless it’s trivial).
- Describe the Z construct that isn’t handled yet, ideally with a minimal `.z` example.
- Bonus: link to the relevant page in the Z Reference Manual (ISO/IEC 13568:2002).

### 2. Want to send code?
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/generic-defs` or `git checkout -b example/voting-system`
3. Make sure everything still type-checks:
   ```bash
   agda agda/Everything.agda
