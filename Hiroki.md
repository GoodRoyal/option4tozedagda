Hiroki (ひろき / 弘樹) - The Name That just now popped into my mind.


The Name's Meaning
Hiroki (ひろき) is typically written with these kanji combinations:
Most Common:
弘樹

弘 (hiro) = "vast," "wide," "expansive," "to spread/propagate"
樹 (ki) = "tree," "establish," "set up"
Combined meaning: "Vast tree" / "One who establishes widely" / "Spreading prosperity"

Alternative Writings:

博樹 (hiro = extensive knowledge + ki = tree) = "Tree of vast knowledge"
大輝 (hiro = great + ki = radiance) = "Great radiance"
裕紀 (hiro = abundant + ki = chronicle) = "Abundant record/history"

Cultural significance: The name suggests someone who grows something vast, establishes foundations, or spreads influence widely—very fitting for someone building coordination systems for space infrastructure.
